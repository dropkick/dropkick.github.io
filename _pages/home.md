Since I hadn't really gone too far down the road of building out this site using my usual bag of tricks, I've decided to take a a crack at putting this together using [Jekyll docs][jekyll] and [Github Pages][github-pages]. Once I get some bones here, this should allow me to be a little more nimble with regard to getting actual content here. Plus, learning a new framework or two is always a good thing.

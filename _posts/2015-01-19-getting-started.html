<p>Much like my forays into amateur radio, this site has come together in fits and starts.</p>

<p>I do this sort of thing for a living, so it&rsquo;s not so much that I don&rsquo;t know what to do or how to do it. Quite the opposite. I know too much &ldquo;what to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lately, I&rsquo;ve had a few things pop into my head that seem like they&rsquo;d be right at home on a site like this. So, that was what it took to kick me it the ass hard enough to make me actually build something.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in the actual bones of how I decided to make this work, there&rsquo;s a bit of a colophon on the <a href="/about/">about page</a>.</p>

<p>As always, you can feel free to hit me up on <a href="http://twitter.com/kg7axd">twitter</a>, by <a href="mailto:jason@kg7axd.com">email</a>, or-of course-track me down on the air.</p>

Much like my forays into amateur radio, this site has come together in fits and starts. 

I do this sort of thing for a living, so it's not so much that I don't know what to do or how to do it. Quite the opposite. I know too much "what to do." 

Lately, I've had a few things pop into my head that seem like they'd be right at home on a site like this. So, that was what it took to kick me it the ass hard enough to make me actually build something. 

If you're interested in the actual bones of how I decided to make this work, there's a bit of a colophon on the [about page][about]. 

As always, you can feel free to hit me up on [twitter][twitter], by [email][email], or-of course-track me down on the air.

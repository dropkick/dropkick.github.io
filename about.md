## How this website is put together

I'm using [Jekyll][jekyll] to generate all of the production files from my collection of content written in [markdown][markdown] and styles generated using [SASS][sass]. 

At the moment I'm hosting everything on [Github Pages][github-pages], though I'll likely be moving it back over to one of my own servers or into [Amazon Web Services][aws] to have a little more flexibility with what I do programatically. For the moment, Github is working out quite nicely.
